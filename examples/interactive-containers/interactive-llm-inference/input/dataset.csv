s50723040,"                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with upper chest and back pain, also bibasilar
 crackles  // Pneumonia? CHF exacerbation?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged. Left mid to
 lower lung opacity is seen, may be representing pleural effusion with
 overlying atelectasis. There is also a right perihilar opacity and likely
 small right pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, with overlying
 atelectasis. Findings better assessed on subsequent CT.

s55312734,"                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with coronary artery disease and
 diabetes, now with cough and chills, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views have been obtained with patient in
 upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next
 preceding portable chest examination of ___.  There is status
 post sternotomy and the presence of surgical clips in the left anterior
 mediastinum are indicative of previous bypass surgery.  The heart size is at
 the upper limit of normal variation without typical configurational
 abnormality.  Unremarkable appearance of thoracic aorta.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not congested.  No evidence of acute pulmonary infiltrates. 
 There is a left-sided lateral obliterated pleural sinus at the lower lateral
 chest wall indicative of old pleural scars, probably related to previous
 bypass surgery, which showed pleural effusions postoperatively on examination
 of ___.  Absence of any blunting in the posterior pleural sinus
 speaks against acute pleural effusion and identifies the area as a pleural
 scar.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post bypass surgery, pleural scar, no evidence of acute
 pulmonary infiltrates or pleural effusions in this patient with cough and
 chills.

s57375967,"                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with hypoxia  // ?pna, aspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   The lungs are adequately
 aerated.
 
 There is a focal consolidation at the left lung base adjacent to the lateral
 hemidiaphragm. There is mild vascular engorgement. There is bilateral apical
 pleural thickening.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is remarkable for aortic arch calcifications.
 The heart is top normal in size.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Focal consolidation at the left lung base, possibly representing aspiration or
 pneumonia.
 
 Central vascular engorgement."
