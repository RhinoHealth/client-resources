# NVIDIA FLARE Example - MIMIC CXR
<br/>

### **Description**

This example contains files to train a pneumonia detection model from Chest XRays using Rhino Health's Federated Computing Platform (FCP) and NVIDIA FLARE v2.0

It shows how to:
* Use PyTorch model code adapted to NVIDIA FLARE (NVFlare) v2.0, and apply the necessary changes for it to run on FCP
* Add an `infer.py` script to perform inference on the trained model
* Package the code in a Docker container that can be used with FCP using pip

Please reference the User Documentation and/or Tutorials for in depth explanations on how to use NVFlare on FCP

### **Resources**
- `config` - This is the standard NVFlare directory for config files
  - `config_fed_client.json` - The standard NVFlare federated client config, setting to 1 epoch for the example 
  - `config_fed_server.json` - The standard NVFlare federated server config, setting the output model weights file to be stored in `/output/model_parameters.pt`
- `custom` - This is the standard NVFlare directory for custom model code, containing the code for the pneumonia model (reading the input data from the `/input` folder in order to work with FCP)
- `infer.py` - A script for running inference on the trained model
- `Dockerfile` - This is the Dockerfile to be used for building the container image with pip
- `requirements.txt` - The python requirements for this project when building with pip
