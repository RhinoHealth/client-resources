# Rhino CoPilot Data Quality Check

This Python script performs data quality checks on five clinical data tables produced by the Harmonization CoPilot to ensure the integrity and consistency of the data. The tables evaluated are:

- `person`
- `visit_occurrence`
- `condition_occurrence`
- `procedure_occurrence`
- `drug_exposure`

## Features

The script includes the following checks for data quality:

1. **Missing Values**:
   - Identifies columns with missing data and reports the count of missing values.

2. **Unique Keys**:
   - Ensures that the primary key columns (e.g., `person_id`, `visit_occurrence_id`) have unique values with no duplicates.

3. **Foreign Keys**:
   - Validates foreign key relationships between tables (e.g., `person_id` in `visit_occurrence` matches `person_id` in `person`).

4. **Date Order**:
   - Ensures that date-related columns have logical ordering (e.g., `start_date` is before or equal to `end_date`).

## File Structure

- **Input Files**: Each table is expected to be loaded as a CSV file located in the `input/` directory. This is the convention used across the Rhino FCP when multiple datasets are to be passed to a given Python Code Object or Generalized Compute Code Object. In the case that any one of these tables was not generated by the CoPilot or is not to be evaluted, the `file_paths` dictionary can be modified. 
  - `input/0/dataset.csv` (Person table)
  - `input/1/dataset.csv` (Visit Occurrence table)
  - `input/2/dataset.csv` (Condition Occurrence table)
  - `input/3/dataset.csv` (Procedure Occurrence table)
  - `input/4/dataset.csv` (Drug Exposure table)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the directory containing the script.

2. Ensure the input CSV files are organized in the paths specified above.

3. Install the necessary Python package:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas
