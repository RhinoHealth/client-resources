Conducting an end-to-end ML project using multimodal data from multiple sites
.

Notebook 1: Data Extraction
In this step, we gain experience in importing multimodal datasets onto the Rhino FCP. We will use MIMIC-IV as the source to create datasets from a database that hosts EHR data. In addition, we will load CXR DICOM images, which are linked to the EHR tables using a mapping lookup table.

Notebook 2: Data Engineering
In this step, the DICOM files (chest x-rays) are converted to JPEG.

Notebook 3: Exploratory Data Analyses, Statistical Testing, and Time Series Analysis
In this step, the user will gain experience using the privacy-preserving exploratory data analytics capabilities of Rhino. We show a few privacy-preserving queries with metrics.

Notebook 4: Running Federated Training of the Pneumonia Model
In this step, you will split the data into training and testing and use the datasets for model training. You will gain experience converting an existing model to NVFlare and execute the FL model training across two sites.

Notebook 5: Federated Evaluations
Visualize the evaluation results.
