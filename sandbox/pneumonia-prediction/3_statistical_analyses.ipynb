    "The `rhino_health` Python library is a robust tool designed to support a wide array of statistical and epidemiological analyses over federated data sets, crucial in the realm of healthcare and medical research. In this notebook, we demonstrate the ability to perform analyses over multiple distributed datasets. More specifically, we'll perform an analysis of data related to pneumonia outcomes and perform both exploratory data analyses to support our machine learning project as well as hypothesis testing for a traditional biostatistics analysis.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Rhino Federated Computing Platform allows you to quickly and securely calculate metrics using federated computing across multiple sites. Each metric on the Rhino platform has two components:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Metric Object\n",
    "\n",
    "The metric configuration object is a crucial component, serving as a blueprint for metric retrieval. It allows you to specify the metric variables, grouping preferences, and data filters. For example, let's define two metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Count of total cases across both cohorts\n",
    "2. Count of positive pneumonia cases across both cohorts\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Response Object\n",
    "\n",
    "When retrieving a metric, *all results are returned in a MetricResponse object*. The MetricResponse object is a Python class that includes the specific outcome values in the 'output' attribute, such as statistical measures, and details about the metric configuration ('metric_configuration_dict').\n",
    "\n",
    "The metric results will always be under the output attribute, under the metric name key (in this case, \"chi_square\"). The metric response values are then stored under the value name (e.g., \"p_value\" in the example above). The initial metric configuration used to generate this output can be found under the \"metric_configuration_dict\" attribute.\n",
